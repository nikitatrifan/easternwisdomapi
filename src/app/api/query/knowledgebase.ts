The concept of self is often misunderstood. While many people perceive the self as a separate entity that owns the body and mind, this is an illusion. The self is not a distinct entity, but rather a construct of our perceptions. This illusion is deeply ingrained and difficult to dispel, as it is often instinctively believed that we are not our bodies or minds, but rather own them. 

A thought experiment illustrates this: if you can imagine desiring someone else's body or mind, it implies that you see yourself as separate from your own body and mind. This illusion of self is pervasive and has influenced philosophical theories across cultures, leading to concepts like the soul or the atman. However, these theories are flawed as they start from a non-existent premise. It's much like studying how deep the water is in a mirage. Instead, we should understand ourselves as persons, entities that are part of the world, interdependent, causally conditioned, and exist in a social context. This understanding provides a richer comprehension of human existence.

Despite intellectual rejection of the concept of self as a separate entity, most people still experience themselves as a subjective entity within their bodies. This is evident in moments of self-consciousness or embarrassment, where we feel like an inner subject at odds with our physical experience. 

This illusion of self also extends to the belief that our experiences and actions occur in an inner space separate from physical space and time. This perception disconnects us from the world, making us feel like spectators or actors, but not part of the world. This illusion of a non-spatial, inner self that inhabits our body and mind is the primary concern.

The concept of the illusion of self is significant for several reasons. Firstly, understanding our own nature is a fundamental human task, and gaining clarity on this can lead to authentic self-understanding. Secondly, the illusion of self often underpins moral egoism and reactive attitudes like blame and anger, which can be damaging. This illusion can also disrupt our relationships and hinder our ability to achieve flow states, which are associated with expertise and happiness. Therefore, understanding and overcoming the self-illusion will lead to happier, more effective lives.

The illusion of self is also linked to psychological suffering. Cutting through this illusion can alleviate such suffering, as it is rooted in the insight into selflessness. This insight is not about eliminating a pre-existing self, but rather realizing that the self was never there to begin with. This realization can change the nature of our experiences and does not require faith, but rather empirical investigation.

From an objective or third-person perspective, the existence of a truly separate self does not make sense. We are inseparable from the physical universe, constantly exchanging atoms with our environment. There is no real boundary between a person and the world, and any actions we take are part of the physics of the universe. This perspective challenges the notion of free will and suggests that our actions are simply part of the total set of all that happens in the universe.

Humans are hyper-social beings, inseparably embedded in both the physical and social universe. Language, a social construct, is a key mechanism through which we understand ourselves. Our self-understanding is not autonomous but is shaped by our social relations and our constant interplay with the physical environment and psychological states of others. 

The concept of 'self' is not necessary in understanding the physical or social world, as it is not a part of the equations in physics, chemistry, biology, or psychology. The 'self' is an illusion, not propagated by our best science.

The Buddhist concept of 'interdependence' or 'dependent origination' is crucial here. It suggests that everything that occurs depends on a vast network of causes and conditions. This interdependence can be understood in three dimensions: causal interdependence, part-whole dependence, and dependence on conceptual imputation.

Causal interdependence refers to the fact that effects depend on their causes. Part-whole dependence means that a whole entity depends on its parts for its existence, and vice versa. Dependence on conceptual imputation suggests that things depend for their identities on the ways we understand them. 

For instance, a five-dollar bill is just a piece of paper with green ink. Its value as 'five dollars' is a result of a vast network of physical causes and conditions and conceptual activity. Similarly, our identities are constructed and interdependent in all these three senses. 

The illusion of the 'self' is the belief that something we've constructed existed independently. Just like we don't believe that money's value existed before we assigned it, we should understand that we've constructed ourselves as persons, rather than discovering that we had selves.

The concept of self, like the concept of a dollar, is a social construct. It exists because we agree it does. However, unlike a dollar, which ceases to exist when we stop acknowledging it, the self is more akin to an unknown virus. It exists whether we acknowledge it or not, and it has properties such as priority, unity, subject-object duality, and agency. 

Despite this, the self is an illusion. It's a phenomenological fact, a fact about our experience, but we must be careful not to mistake how things seem to us for how they are. We are subject to illusions, some constant, like the illusion that our senses simply deliver the world to us, and some occasional, like optical illusions. 

The properties we assign to the illusory self, such as independence, free agency, pure subjectivity, unity, and simplicity, are properties of the illusion. For instance, the illusion of free agency, especially in Western cultures, suggests we can do whatever we want, that we are exempt from the causal matrix. This idea, originating from Saint Augustine, was created to exempt God from the blame for human evil. 

However, this idea of free will is not supported by psychological theory. There is no \\"will\\" part of the brain. The idea of the will is inert in psychological theory. The concept of free will is deeply tied to the idea of the self, and to find the self, we'd have to find something that is causally exempt, which doesn't exist. 

When we examine ourselves, we discover a complex of constantly changing phenomena, not a simple, single thing. We don't find a single \\"I\\" behind all of that, but rather a complex more like a committee than an individual thing. 

When we see ourselves as natural organisms in a causal nexus, with an identity that we constitute, we begin to see who we are. This is very different from the \\"I\\" that we think we are when we succumb to the self illusion. 

By taking the dualistic starting point of pure subjectivity seriously, we can move towards understanding this. We are the subject aware of objects, and because we can be aware of them, they are not us. However, the feeling of being a self is itself an object. It is an appearance, a feeling. 

Consciousness, that which is aware of the feeling of self, must be prior to it and unimplicated in it. This feeling of being a self is an object and does not constrain what consciousness is. By recognizing that everything, including the feeling of being a subject, is appearing in a condition that is aware of appearances, we can begin to feel that the condition itself doesn't feel like \\"I\\". It doesn't feel like a self. This is the way to understand consciousness and its contents without the usual subject-object duality.`;

Meditation is a recognition of consciousness before it becomes entangled with thought. Our experience of the world is often dominated by incessant, unnoticed thoughts that feel like our self. This identification with thought can be interrupted, leading to a sense of a more expansive mind. This can occur spontaneously, through meditation, or with the use of psychedelics. 

The majority of our self-talk is not beneficial to our happiness and is based on an illusion of selfhood. When we break this identification with thought, we create more mental space and reduce the influence of the past and future on the present. 

Meditation is not a practice, but a cessation of distraction by thought. It allows us to notice thoughts as appearances in consciousness, which reduces their emotional force. This doesn't inhibit our ability to think or plan, but it does reduce our suffering. 

Negative emotions like anger or fear are still relevant cues, but their half-life is brief when one knows how to meditate. It's impossible to sustain these emotions for long without being taken in by thought again. 

The ability to control our minds is crucial, as uncontrolled minds can lead to personal and societal suffering. The ability to be skeptical about one's own opinions is also a valuable, yet often untrained skill.

Seeing the illusion of the self is the state of being aware of your experiences without getting lost in thoughts about them. Most people are often lost in their own narratives, filtering their present experiences through constant conceptualization, narration, andjudgment. Seeing the illusion of the self reveals that consciousness, the part of us that is aware of experiences, has characteristics that provide relief and well-being. Our efforts to solve problems are essentially attempts to find reasons to relax into the present moment. Consciousness is a state where things continually appear and change. It's not about making certain experiences persist forever, which is impossible due to the nature of consciousness and neurophysiology. Instead, it's about recognizing the open and unstructured nature of consciousness, where everything arises and passes away. The freedom comes from recognizing that the entity aware of joy is the same as that aware ofsadness, fear, or anxiety. Consciousness itself never takes the form of what it knows. It's like a mirror, reflecting everything brought before it without being affected by it. With seeing the illusion of the self, you can experience a state of equanimity, where the nature of your experience doesn't matter. In these moments, you can't find your problems. Although you may pick them up again when you start thinking about your life, it's a relief to experience this interruption of reactivity. The purpose of life is to live asmeaningfully as possible. Don't confuse meaning with happiness and excitement. If you're suffering, you're lost in thought. Seeing the illusion of the self allows you to interrupt this process.
