There's a distinction, and one that I think is very important, between the self and the person. And so while I argue that the self is a nonexistent thing, and a chimera, I'm not denying that we exist as persons, and I want to replace the idea that we exist as selves with the idea that we exist as persons. The second thing to say is that when I think about illusion, I tend to think of this in a very Indian way. And in most Indian philosophical traditions, including the Buddhist tradition, an illusion is always defined as something that exists in one way, but appears in another way. So for instance, when we say that a mirage is an illusion, we mean that it exists as a refraction pattern of light, but it appears to be water. When we look at the Müller-Lyer illusion, we say that those two lines exist as equally long, but appear to be different. So when I talk about the self-illusion, I'm going to be talking about the person existing as a person, but often illusorily taken to be a self. So what do I mean by a self? I mean by the self the thing that we kind of instinctively, atavistically think that we are. The me that owns my body. The me that stands behind and owns my mind. The subject of my mental states. The agent that acts upon the world, but isn't quite in the world. So when I say that I naively and instinctively don't take myself to be my body or to be my mind, but to own them as a separate thing, well, that sounds crazy, but it is how we think. Just imagine somebody whose body you'd like to have for a little while or for a long time. The moment you form that desire, whether the desire makes sense or not, you've told yourself that you are not your body or something that has a body, and that could in principle have some other body. And you can do the same thing with your mind. You can imagine a mind you would really love to have for a little while or for a long time. And if you can form that desire, then you don't regard yourself as identical to your mind. You regard yourself as something that has a mind and could have a very different mind, maybe a better one, maybe a worse one. But it's that thing that we think of behind our experience, the thing that's pure subject and never object, that's pure agent, that acts upon the world, that we take to be free of the causal nexus. That's the thing that I take to be the self. And I think that it's almost maybe a universal illusion that that's the way in which we exist, even though when we subject it to analysis, we find that it doesn't make a lot of sense. What I think we need to do is to try to work our way out of that illusion and come to understand ourselves as persons, things that are part of the world, that are embedded in the world, that are embodied, that are interdependent, that are causally conditioned, that are kind of continua of psychophysical processes rather than individual things and that only exist in interaction with other persons in a social context. We understand intellectually that whatever we are as minds and agents is arising out of the whole body, but when you pay attention, when you feel what in you is implicated when someone looks into your eyes or points at you or refers to you, when you become self-conscious before a crowd, there is this experience of being an inner subject that is threatened or implicated. You feel, and in that case, just take the case of acute self-consciousness, your own face becomes a kind of mask. You're not identical to your face. You're behind your face, and in some sense, your face is misbehaving. I mean, think of what it's like to be so embarrassed that you're blushing. And you're blushing, obviously, against your will, and you are the one implicated in the center of it all, feeling at war with your experience. And in those moments, your body is in some sense part of the world. You are the inner man or woman, and everything else is out there. And it is from that place of being this embattled subject that virtually everyone seeks to have a better experience in life, to get out of the position of always looking over your own shoulder and being abstracted away from your experience, but rather to have experiences that are so good and compelling that you're unified with them. And then we call these experiences flow experiences or peak experiences, those moments of unselfconscious unity with an athletic performance or an intellectual engagement or pure pleasure, whatever it is, those become highlights of the day, and the rest is us as subjects thinking, thinking, thinking, talking to ourselves in a way that is paradoxical and perhaps we can examine, but it is a subset of the person. It is the subject inside that is the self, whatever you may believe about its emergent dependency on the brain and the rest of the body and its entanglement with the world. Having a kind of inner experience or inner world and part of the self-illusion is the illusion that our experiences and our actions happen in a kind of inner space that's outside of physical space and time and that somehow physical space and time is all exterior to us but that we have this inner life happening in an inner space and what that does is it kind of removes us in consciousness from the world and takes the world to be something of which we're a kind of spectator or upon which we can act but to which we don't belong and again the moment we say it it might sound crazy so that nobody thinks that on reflection perhaps well some people probably do but most of us don't but the moment we stop reflecting we fall right back into it and that's the illusion just as you could measure those lines in the Mueller-Lyer diagram convince yourself that they are the same length but still when you look at them they look different just when we look at our experience it feels broken into subject and object, inner and outer, agent and action and that all implicates this idea of a non-spatio-temporal inner ego or self that inhabits our body and mind or makes use of our body and mind in engaging with the world and that's the illusion that I'm really concerned with here. I also think as you pointed out earlier the place where the self-illusion disappears is when we're in flow states and when we're in flow states we're in states of real expertise as well as states of real happiness and if we can understand that the self-illusion is one that breaks flow and takes us out of real expertise and can often suck the joy out of our lives then becoming more aware of the self-illusion might enable us to be more attentive to what brings us into flow and so lead us to live happier more effective lives. So for all of those reasons I think this isn't a matter of kind of idle philosophical curiosity but one that can actually enrich our lives if we get clearer about it.

Psychological suffering that is anchored to this feeling of self and when you can cut through the illusion that suffering itself can evaporate, that is it this insight into “selflessness” is a kind of you know psychologically speaking a kind of universal solvent of psychological suffering and that is the the explicit promise of buddhist soteriology suffering and the end of suffering right we're talking the whole buddhist project was to or the buddha's whole project was to diagnose why we suffer and an insight into selflessness is at the root of the the remedy there and I mean I would just say personally this is something obviously I'm interested in the the philosophical and conceptual side of this but for me personally being able to experience the illusoriness of the self has been the most important thing I've ever learned in my life and it's just with it and it's really it's really one without a doubt and it shouldn't be surprising that it can be experienced, because we're making a claim about what's true about the nature of consciousness in each moment and the claim is not that there is a self and you can by some process of analysis or meditative insight get rid of it it's no there's it is not there in the first place and it can be discovered its absence can be discovered in a way that changes the character of experience, it's absence can be felt it's absence can be be made salient and that isn't a claim that needs to be taken on faith by anyone it's merely an empirical claim that is there to be investigated, so the goal of a conversation like this if not to actually precipitate that experience in the listener is to make the terrain sound plausible enough that a person has some indication of of where they would look to find it and the you know the path by which they they might actually arrive there so it's a more essentially describing the map to the territory as clearly as we can and to that end let's talk about this from both the so-called objective or third-person side and the subjective or first-person side because they they yield substantially the same view in my experience.

They seem very different from the third-person side when we're talking about the physical universe that includes bodies and brains and you know everything that science and most of western philosophy is going to acknowledge to be real there the existence of a truly separate self a truly dualistic picture of what a person is doesn't make any sense at all i mean it's just it's obvious from that point of view that there is simply the physical universe and you are arising within it as an expression of it you're inseparable from it materially you're constantly exchanging atoms with it across the boundary of your skin you're breathing yourself out and you're breathing in the environment there is no there's no real boundary that a physicist is going to want to fight for here and it's on that basis that any radical disjunction between a person and the world can be denied and and this is where this is why a notion of free will you know as in libertarian free will never made any sense to anyone who thought about it i mean it's just obvious that there's the total set of all that happens in the universe and fully within that part of the venn diagram as a subset of what happens are all the things that quote you do right your actions are part of the physics of things and can't be otherwise and so i guess throwing it back to you here do you see that as a an incontestable and non-controversial starting point from the outside yeah i think that's an extremely important starting point i would only add one aspect to that if i might and that is that as hyper social beings which we are in which we you know we've evolved into that kind of status we don't only find ourselves inseparably embedded in the physical universe we find ourselves inseparably embedded in a social universe embedded with other people with other persons and that becomes extraordinarily important because one of the mechanisms of that embedding one of the many mechanisms is language and when we acquire language we acquire a medium through which we introspect and through which we understand ourselves that's entirely transformative and we can have the kind of illusion that when i find myself for instance believing right now that i'm talking to you that i do that by introspecting and finding a little sentence in there that says hey jay right now you're talking to sam but that's of course crazy i'm interpreting my own myself in terms of a language that's socially constituted i understand myself as a philosopher or as a teacher or as a son or as a father in terms of social relations and so we end up being constructed not as autonomous beings who enter a world and then interact with it but we're constructed and emerge out of a world that is both physical and social and everything we are reflects that fact and reflects that constant interdependence and that dynamic interplay between our bodies and the physical environment around us between our psychological states and the psychological states of others and you just can't understand who we are without that i think that's extraordinarily important and as you put it if we were to do physics or chemistry or biology or psychology we can do all of that and we do all of that without ever saying oh yes and then there's the self and we've got to think about that too because it simply falls out of the equation it's not part of that that illusion isn't one that's propagated by our best science yeah you used a word interdependent there which obviously has buddhist overtones and links up with a another concept of that we might refer to by the phrase conventional existence of things yes maybe we should uh explain some of that uh or introduce some of those distinctions and you know this in your book you reference the um the story of uh king melinda and nagasena to do this and you also you use a few other examples i you know hume has um an approach here with his church analogy so maybe talk about the way in which the things and you know including people uh in the world exist but their existence is a kind of paradox and or things exist by convention which is not quite the same thing as something existing truly independently from everything else that's right oftentimes when people hear the idea of conventional truth as opposed to ultimate truth

they think that what this is is a kind of second class sort of reality an ersatz sort of reality that isn't really real something you do until ultimate truth comes along but that's a deep misunderstanding so let's begin with the idea of dependent origination and then work our way into into conventional existence when in the buddhist world we talk about dependent origination we mean that everything that occurs occurs in dependence on a vast network of countless causes and conditions my speaking depends upon all kinds of things happening in my nervous system but it also depends upon my being able to breathe and there being oxygen in the air it depends upon the things that i've been taught the things upon which i've reflected it depends upon the fact that you're at the other end of this conversation and that i see you as an interlocutor when we talk about that dependence in the buddhist world we often distinguish three different dimensions of that interdependence the first the one i've been stressing so far is causal interdependence effects depend upon their causes and there are many different kinds of causes some of which are antecedent some of which are simultaneous we don't need to worry about that botany now but even when you think about an ordinary event like say turning the lights on you might say that flicking the switch is the cause you might say that the power plant and the electric grid are the cause of the lights being on you might say that your desire to read is the cause for the lights being on all kinds of different causes to which we can appeal so the causal nexus isn't linear it's a real mesh but secondly we talk about part whole dependence the technical term for that is myriological dependence so a whole entity depends for its existence on its parts i depend on my liver and my spleen and my lungs and my hair and all of that stuff to be who i am but parts also depend upon their holes my heart can't function as a heart without being embedded in my body my liver isn't my liver unless it's in me and so forth or to take other kinds of analogies the college at which i teach depends upon its faculty and its students and its library and its buildings and its administrators and so forth but each of those things depends upon the college in order to be a classroom building or a teacher or a student or an administrator so that's a bi-directional myriological interdependence yeah but the third form of interdependence the hardest one for most people to get their minds around but the most important one in some ways for the present purposes is dependence on conceptual imputation that is things depend for their identities upon the ways in which we understand them and i want to start with a really easy example to make that clear and it's an example that i use throughout the book and that's the example of money if i've got a five dollar bill in my hand nobody denies that it's actually true that i've got five dollars there unless it's counterfeit of course but what i've got is a piece of paper in green ink there's nothing about the paper in the green ink that make it worth five dollars it's worth five dollars because we've got the institution of the federal reserve because i can exchange it for five ones because i can buy something with it people will accept it for as as a five dollar note unlike say an iou or some confederate money and it's important to see that the identity of that piece of paper as a five dollar note depends upon this vast network not only of physical causes and conditions but of conceptual activity that constitutes its value as a five dollar note i mean after all if i've got a five dollar note and a twenty dollar note the paper and the ink are worth exactly the same in both of those cases it's not like there's four times as much really cool paper and ink in the twenty dollar note as there is in the five but we have different conceptual responses to them and those conceptual responses don't reflect the identity of the two notes as a five and a ten rather they constitute that identity and the more we look the more we see that almost everything that we take seriously as a real existent is interdependent in all of these three senses it's causally interdependent it's myriologically interdependent but it's also dependent for its identity on our conceptual resources now that's important because when we think about things that are extended in time like persons who often live for you know 60 70 80 90 100 years and we think about the difference between what that person was when its body was brand new when it first you know was delivered out of the womb and what it might be like when it's an adult or an agent being those are very different bodies but we unite them through a conceptual imputation by seeing that they're physically causally connected that they share some parts that they that one is the secret that one part of the sequence is caused by earlier parts of the sequence and we conceptually decide to say let's call that one thing and that gives us a person but that person is something that is every bit as constructed as an entity as a dollar bill is but just because the dollar bill or the twenty dollar bill or the five dollar bill just because the fact that those are constructed doesn't make them unreal but rather describes that in which their reality consists when we understand the constructed nature of our own identities a construction in which we are not the only agents in which other people participate as well we see that our existence as constructed beings doesn't amount to our non-existence rather it constitutes our mode of existence when we understand ourselves as persons we understand ourselves as interdependent artifacts in that sense hume in the in the treatise of human nature makes the beautiful point that human beings are natural artificers that we are born to make things among the things we make are cookies and cakes houses and cities but we also make cultures we also make ideas and I think that the deepest part of this whole um our activity as artificers is that one of the things that we make is ourselves and in a lot of ways we persons are the most sophisticated things that we human beings make as natural artificers and so oftentimes you can understand the illusion of the self as the illusion that something that we've in fact made was something that existed independently and that we just found it would be as though you thought that here's how money originated somewhere on a beach somebody saw lots of pieces of paper and coins and then noticed that they were each valuable and that you could exchange them for things and you could put them in the bank and so they started doing that but that the value in the coins in the papers was just there before we did anything with them nobody would accept that view I want to suggest that it's exactly that way with us that we're not just great apes who happen to be to discover that they were persons but we've constructed ourselves as persons and then erroneously think that that's because we noticed that we had selves okay so I can imagine some listener being very skeptical about this analogy to the dollar the claim would be well it's obvious that there are different types of existence among all the myriad objects and properties in the world and yes some things are socially constructed some things only exist by virtue of our agreeing they that they exist and money is among those many things you know something is a dollar because we say it is and the moment we stop saying it is well then it ceases to be that and there are you know there are cocktail parties and corporations and other things might be constructed in this way but there are other things that exist whether or not we even know about them much less have formed the right concepts about them but and and had conversations about them so you know if a new virus comes flying out of a bat next week and begins to spread surreptitiously throughout the world making people sick well that virus is what it is whether we know about it or not and its efficacy in making people sick will be what it what it is whether we've learned to even talk about it or not much less cure it so there are different ways in which things exist and perhaps the self is much more like a an unknown an unnamed virus than it is like a dollar that was the mere invention of people at a certain moment in time and that the self has and now i'm referencing your book and and your own terminology this self has the properties of priority and unity and subject object duality and agency of the kind that we discover in ourselves it's me in here and i can think and do whatever the hell i want and i have free will i'm a me yes i'm in my body perhaps in some paradoxical way and i'm sure i'm dependent on my brain in ways that i can't introspect about but all of this highfalutin talk about interdependence and emergent causation and all the rest maybe there's something of interest to say there with respect to the neuroscience of being a self or the the information processing aspect of of what's actually happening in my brain but as a matter of phenomenology as a matter of lived experience there's a simple point of view that is as undeniable as any conceivable feature of experience and it's that i'm me and i'm not you and so none of what you've said really has put that into question that's right not nothing that i've said so far in this conversation has but now maybe it's time to start doing that because what you've done is very ably characterized the self illusion and part of the uh the kind of tell there the giveaway is that you talked about it as a kind of undeniable phenomenological fact a fact about our experience and i think that we have to be really careful when we go from how things seem to us to how they are because of course we know that we're all subject to illusions of all kinds some of those illusions are what you might call accidental illusions like the muller liar illusion that you've got a kind of you encounter sometimes but not others or the bent stick illusion or something like that other illusions are pretty constant so for instance the illusion that our visual field is uniformly colored or that it doesn't have a hole in the center of it the illusion that our senses simply deliver the world to us just as they are instead of thinking about perception as a complicated neurological construction system and so forth so that we can we know that we can't simply go from the the phenomenology to metaphysics directly and so that's an important cautionary right there now when we start looking at the properties that you correctly assigned to the illusory self things like primordial independence free agency pure subjectivity unity simplicity all of those those are properties of the illusion and we can kind of see that in a bunch of different ways let's start with the one that you've mentioned um several times already and that i haven't really addressed and that's the question of free agency oftentimes especially in modern western cultures we part of the self illusion is the illusion that we can literally do whatever we want that we've got libertarian freedom and that's the illusion that while everything else is part of the causal matrix that somehow we stand outside of that causal matrix the real locus classicus for that of course in the western tradition is saint augustine who basically invented the idea of free will and when he did that he invented two things one was the idea of a will as a kind of component of of the ego and the other was its exemption from the laws of causality and the theological reasons for doing that have to do with theodicy and we don't have to go there but it is worth pointing out that if you've taken a psychology course you don't suddenly find oh yes and there's the will that's the will part of the brain or first there's a cause a perception then there's a bit of will and then there's an action the idea of the will simply is completely inert in psychological theory let's um spell that out a little more because there's a point that i'm embarrassed i've never made before given my bona fides as a critic of organized religion and organized abrahamic religion in particular but this idea of the will from augustine is really the whole point is to get god off the hook for human evil right that's right i mean this is all about the garden of eden yeah and the fall yeah so it's worth reminding ourselves of this i guess i mean i don't want to bash the entire christian tradition that's not my my my axe to grind but this one is a pretty serious one augustine was worried about whose fault it was that we fell from eden and the problem is that if we understand god as omniscient omnipotent and omnibenevolent it sounds like he should have known he had to have known that eve was going to take the apple from the snake he had to have really wanted her not to do that because he knew what a bad thing that was and because he was omnipotent he had to be able to stop it but he didn't and so if you put those things together it makes it sound like the fall is god's fault and augustine was worried about that because you can't blame god for stuff like that and the way that he got god off the hook was to invent this faculty of voluntas of will which was a new faculty to create and he said that we have this general faculty to act and what's more that faculty is special in that it's exempted from causation and so there's nothing god could have done because eve was free and could do things free of causation so even though he was omnipotent omniscient and omnibenevolent he couldn't have stopped her from doing what she freely did. Now if you are worried about talking snakes and apples from magical trees and the origins of evil and a triple omni-god then perhaps you should take the idea of a free will seriously but my point here is that if that's not what drives you metaphysically then you better recognize that that's the origin of this idea and that to the extent that we think of ourselves as selves and so as free agents outside of the causal nexus even though we know that we are biological organisms in a causally determined world then you've really got a crazy picture of who you are an alienating picture and it's a picture that as I said earlier both can lead to illegitimate feelings of pride, shame, guilt, I did this but can also lead to very dangerous attributions of blame and anger failing to see that other people just like me fail to have this kind of free will and I think that extirpating this myth of freedom is a really important task of philosophy but what I'm trying to also do in this book is to show that that myth of freedom is tied deeply to the idea of the self and so one of the reasons that we want to say that the self isn't something that we just found is because to find it we'd have to find something that was causally exempt and there isn't anything that's causally exempt. We also have to find something that's simple and when we look at who we are how we act how we perceive and how we understand what we discover is a complex of constantly changing phenomena not some simple single thing that persists through those phenomena. When we look at subjectivity we don't find a single eye lying behind all of that we see perceptual subjectivity affective subjectivity within perceptual subjectivity auditory visual tactile olfactory subjectivity what we see is a complex more like a committee than an individual thing so when you start losing simplicity and and this kind of perfect subject and free agency you start seeing that this kind of mythical apparent thing really isn't there at all it's as though you were looking at those lines of the Mueller liar illusion and as you erase the arrowheads on each side the lines come back into a perception of equality and when you see them that way you see them correctly when we see ourselves as natural organisms in a enmeshed in a causal nexus with an identity that we constitute then you begin to see who we are and that's very different from the eye that I think that I am when I succumb to the self illusion. Hmm well it's interesting I think we you can get there by taking the dualistic starting point of pure subjectivity seriously so in taking duality seriously one can move this way I mean so you you are the subject aware of objects and you're this you know you're let's whatever your beliefs about this subject or not leave that aside but as a matter of experience there is this experience to be had of just being a pure witness of all the things that can be noticed sights sounds sensations thoughts feelings etc objects out in the world and because you can be aware of them as objects that testifies to the fact that they are not you right you are something else over here that is aiming attention like a spotlight upon all the all the objects and and the fact that you can be aware of something proves that it's on the object side of this subject object chasm and therefore not you right you are just the subject but if you persist in doing that what you notice is that this feeling of being a self is itself a kind of object right it is an appearance of a kind however inscrutable otherwise you would never sense that it was so right and and certainly you could never experience a loss of this feeling unless it is in fact a feeling right so there's some signature inexperience that we're calling self there is a sense that it feels like something to be me or in the middle right that this thing that's being that we're criticizing this thing we're saying doesn't exist the denial of that critique feels like something and if that feeling suddenly went away then there'd be no basis upon which to say i'm a self in the appropriating experience from the middle of experience and so if you take this duality seriously you notice that well okay consciousness that that which is aware of the feeling of self must be prior to it and actually unimplicated in it in the same way it's unimplicated in the existence of the water bottle i can see on my desk right that's over there as an object and so this feeling in the face or in the head or in the body whatever it is the energetics of it that whatever the signature is of feeling individuated internal to the body that is itself a kind of object and therefore doesn't actually constrain what consciousness is in itself as a matter of experience this is a it's a logical point but more importantly it's a phenomenological one because you can if you keep falling back into that position of just recognizing that everything including this feeling of being a subject is appearing all by itself in a condition that is aware of appearances that you can begin to feel that the condition itself doesn't feel like i it doesn't feel like a self right and that that is the the way to punch through to this base layer of just consciousness and its contents which can be experienced without that usual subject object duality that's right and it's subject object duality that's you know kind of the bogeyman in this particular context.

The word meditation can mean many different things to people, but what I think it should mean is just a simple recognition of what consciousness is like prior to entanglement with thought. We're having an experience of the world that's happening in five sensory channels, but there's this other mode or this other aspect to our condition, which is our thinking about what we directly experience through our senses. And for most people, most of the time, the thoughts are incessant and uninspected. And they're arising as unnoticed. So it just feels like you. So you'll say something that I disagree with and there's a voice in me which says, well, what's he talking about? Or like, what does that mean? Or like, well, like, but what he did, but you just, like, there's just that voice that, you know, is that either feels like a self, I mean, in, you know, nearly a hundred percent of the cases that just feels like I, right? That feels like it's me. And then you're told something about the project of, well, again, you see, you could have an experience haphazardly or on psychedelics where that gets, that identification gets interrupted. Where all of a sudden there's just, the mind is suddenly much more vast than that. It doesn't feel like there's a subject in the head looking out through your eyes at a world that's not you and, you know, forever implicated by the glances of other people and the opinions of other people. And it's just me in here, this sort of embattled ego trying to navigate a world that is fundamentally or at least potentially hostile to my interests. Like that subject-object dichotomy where it's just like, I'm the man in the boat trying to steer it, you know, to some safe place and not go over the falls emotionally. That suddenly relaxes, again, it matters now, I guess, maybe I'm talking about psychedelics because it's more replicatable for people. Depending on what drug you've taken, that can relax in one or another way. I mean, MDMA is really just the relaxing of the emotional tone of all that without the pyrotechnics of changing your perceptions. If it's LSD or psilocybin, you could have a much more fundamental transformation of how you perceive the world. But whatever's the case, it just so happens that our nervous systems are perturbable pharmacologically or just by happenstance. This could happen to you just because it happens to you. And people have those stories. But there's vast testimony on this topic that you can experience your mind as a much vaster place than you tend to experience it as. And when you come back from one of those experiences, you might become interested in what is it that trims it down so reliably to this experience of confinement where you feel like it's just me here feeling uptight again. You know, like what's that about? Virtually 100% of that is just what it's like to be you identified with thought. And then if you're identified with thought habitually, you are at the mercy of whatever you happen to think about. The analogy I've drawn somewhere is just, it's like the most boring person in the world comes to the front door of your house and takes you hostage. Follows you from room to room, telling you the same stories over and over again. You can't shut him up and you can't get away from him. And it's just, and that's your life. And you're thinking about the past, about what you could have said or should have said or almost said. You're thinking about the future, what's this, what's, you know, how's this going to go? And most of the futures you visualize never happened the way you've obsessed about them in the first place. So like 99% of your self-talk is, at best it's neutral with respect to its emotional tone. I mean, that's really, some people have, I'm convinced some people have a fairly happy self-talk and that's, you know, it's sort of hard to get through to them because they really don't think of themselves as ever suffering much psychologically, right? They're very confident, they love the people in their lives, they get a lot of love back. They're not really conflict, they don't have regrets and disappointments that they're trailing. They're not, you know, they're not worried about anything and they just want to get up and do it again tomorrow because they're having so much fun. There are people like that. Most people are not like that, right? Most people are sensitive to this criticism of the default, which is most of what you're saying to yourself isn't making you happy and worse, it's predicated on a fundamental illusion of selfhood, of identification with this subset of your mental experience, which is this, again, this discursive thought. And when you break that identification, there's just much more space there. And the past and the, it is in thought, it's in identification with thought that the past and the future exert their weight on the present, right? So like, it's because we're processing everything we experience in the present through this scrim of discursive thought that we don't, we never actually make satisfying contact with the present or we rarely do. And those moments where we do, you know, those kind of peak experience moments, what has made it be a peak is breaking the spell of thought for long enough for just to let in some of the breeze of, you know, awareness that is always, I mean, it's always there, but we just don't, you know, we're blocking it continually. We just haven't opened the door or the window. And it's, so meditation really is, again, there are many different techniques or many different ways to describe it and frame it. In the end, it's actually not even a practice you're doing. It's not, in the end, it is something you're ceasing to do. It's just, it's non-distraction. You're ceasing to be distracted by thought. You're starting to notice thoughts themselves as appearances in consciousness and noticed as appearances, they don't have force. They don't have, they certainly don't have emotional force. It's not like you suddenly become an idiot and you can't figure out what you want to eat for dinner or, you know, how to find your car or, I mean, you can think and you can plan, but the moment you begin to suffer, you become, your new default is to become interested in, it's like a mindfulness alarm, you know, starts sounding and then you relax your identification with it, just the physiology of suffering. I mean, so to bring it back to what we were just talking about. So yeah, there's a moment where I notice something that I find, you know, either like personally annoying or the appropriate target of moral outrage. I mean, I don't think we should get, I'm not envisioning psychological health as being synonymous with never being angry ever again or never being fearful ever again. Negative emotions are, you know, from an enlightened point of view in my book, are still salience cues. Like if I walk outside this house on the way to my car and someone physically attacks me on the sidewalk, like I don't want to be just a puddle of goo, you know, just beaming love at the person. Now, it's not to say that there's not, that's not a possible state of consciousness. It certainly is. And it actually, there are definitely scenarios where that quote works. Like just being the guy who's, you know, beaming unconditional love as your only response to anything. It's possible to get out of some physical altercation because it's so surprising. When is it, when do you, when do you want to cease being angry so that you can actually function intelligently? It happens very, very soon after the arising of anger. I mean, like, you don't, you don't want to stay angry, right? But the initial jolt of anger in many cases is totally appropriate and it is the orienting response that you actually need to respond intelligently to the, you know, whatever the, you know, emergency or quasi-emergency is. So, but once you know how to meditate, you do notice that the half-life of negative emotions is really, really brief. It's actually impossible to stay angry or embarrassed or, you know, whatever it is, pick your negative emotion for longer than, you know, some tens of seconds unless you then, you're taken in by thought again about why you should be angry or why you should be embarrassed. And yeah, your life becomes completely different when you can get off the ride. You know, I mean, the difference between being angry for ten seconds and being angry for ten minutes even, you know, much less ten hours or ten days is enormous. I mean, just, you just think of how life-deranging those periods are where you're just helplessly motivated by anger. I mean, ten minutes is enough to completely fuck up your life. I mean, to say the thing to your spouse that you, you can't, to ring the bell you can't unring. And I mean, just like, you just see how people's lives run off the rails because their minds are out of control and literally everything we see out there that is producing massive human suffering and, you know, existential risk even, you know, like literally everything beyond naturally occurring disasters, right, is a matter of people's minds being out of control, right? I mean, we just have, we just have, we're running terrible legacy code, you know, in a condition of increasingly destabilizing power amplified by technology. I mean, it's getting increasingly easy for one person to screw it up for the rest of us. I mean, so the topic of existential risk is its own thing, which I'm focusing on more and more. I think it's, you know, it's, and it's, you know, neglected to a scary degree. I mean, it's just, there's not that, there are not enough people thinking about how we can shore up our civilization against existential risk and, you know, man-made and otherwise. But I mean, so much of the daily evidence of conflict and needless human misery is just born of people being captured by their thoughts and not knowing that there's any alternative. They're just, they're just talking to themselves. And they're just claiming to know things that they don't know and being persuaded by those, those inner proclamations. What does it feel like to have a very strong opinion that is going to dictate everything you do next? And how often is that just an automaticity that's totally uninspected that would be, could be completely deflated just with another, with just a moment's pause if you only knew how to, or just take the other side in that. Forget about meditation for a moment, just the ability to be skeptical about one's own opinions. Like, that is, talk about an untrained skill. That's just something that almost nobody has. Nobody even has it as a possible norm that you could endorse even in the abstract. Like, why would you want to be skeptical about your own opinions? Like, this is just what I think.

Just to be clear, what mindfulness is, is the condition of noticing what your experience is like without being lost in thought about it. 99.9% of people time lost in a story they're telling themselves about their lives. And everything in the present moment, no matter how pleasant or unpleasant, is coming through this filter of endlessly conceptualizing and discursively narrating and reacting to and judging experience. And what you discover when you learn to be mindful is that consciousness, that in you which is aware of experience, has certain characteristics which are, which convey the relief and well-being that you are otherwise disposed to seek through all your efforts. Soon some level, all of our efforts to solve our problems are a matter of trying to have a good enough reason just to be able to relax into the present moment. Really relax. So that you can put down the burden of your life and give up the war and just come to rest. And so it's not about always finding a joy that doesn't go away or finding a peak experience that doesn't go away, because whatever comes is going to go, right? But what you have is you have this condition in which things are continually appearing and changing. And this is, you know, consciousness, for lack of a better word. And it is never a matter of getting some of the contents of consciousness to persist for all time. Because that's impossible. I mean, it's neurophysiologically impossible. It's just the physics of things. The nature of something that arises is to pass away. And yet, this condition in which everything is arising and passing away, sight, sound, sensations, thoughts, moods, emotions, that is, it really is open and unstructured. And the more you drop back into it and just witness the flow of experience, the more you begin to feel the freedom that comes with just recognizing that that which is aware of joy is the same thing as that which is aware of sadness or depression or fear or anxiety. And it is actually not deeply colored or, in the end, colored at all by what's appearing. And so the key to finding deep equanimity, even with a quintessentially negative experience like sadness or physical pain, is to recognize that consciousness itself never actually takes the form of what it knows. And there are many analogies here, but one is it's like a mirror. Whatever you put in front of a mirror, it is reflected by it, it's completely apparent within it, and yet the mirror never takes the shape of the ugly thing that has been brought before it. It's never improved by the beautiful thing that's been brought before it. And you can actually, I mean, again, it takes some training to do this, but when you really establish an experience of mindfulness where it's, you know, you're mindful for long enough so that you can really test the character and quality of consciousness in many moments strung together, you can see that, yeah, it's... There is a phenomenon that, you know, the Tibetan Buddhists call one taste, where it's just it doesn't matter what your experience is in those moments. And so in those moments, and again, those can be, you know, a hard one for some of us, but in those moments, it really is a matter of not being able to find any of your problems, right? Now, you'll pick them up again in the next moment when you're thinking about your life, but it's an incredible relief to know and to experience this kind of interruption of reactivity, where you just see, like, you know, whatever else is going on in your life, you can actually find real rest, again, if only for a moment, but you could do that a hundred times a day, and that's what the training ultimately is. Yeah. I totally agree. My fifth answer is this, the purpose of life is to live as meaningfully as possible, and we talked about what a meaningful life is during the last question, but just to reiterate from Melody, don't confuse meaning with happiness and excitement, that is just part of the overall process. If you're suffering, you are lost in thought. And that is, I mean, as an algorithm to, or heuristic to have running in your brain, that's, it's incredibly instructive, because I guarantee you, if you are psychologically miserable in any way, you are just, you have been thinking continuously without noticing it. And until you know how to be mindful, there will be no alternative. But once you know how to be mindful, you will be able to interrupt that process.
